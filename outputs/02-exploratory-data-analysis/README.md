## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section presents visualizations of univariate, bivariate, and composite score analyses
conducted before and after feature engineering.

The visualizations explore:
- Customer engagement behavior
- Platform-level performance differences
- Relationships between engagement, trust, and purchasing behavior

EDA insights guided feature engineering and model selection.
