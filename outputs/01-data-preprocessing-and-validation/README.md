## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Validation

This section contains visual diagnostics used to clean, process, and 
validate the integrity of the dataset after cleaning and imputation.

The visualizations compare:
- Raw vs cleaned distributions
- Before-and-after imputation effects
- Preservation of data structure after preprocessing

These checks ensure that preprocessing strategies improved data quality
without introducing bias or distortion.
